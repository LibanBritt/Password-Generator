This project was about making a password generator that can features lowercase numbers - uppercase - number and special character. 

I did this by making an array for all 4 possiblities and making a function that runs on click via event listener that holds all 4 variables. Depending on if the users input when the 'confirm' command runs for each variable then the website will generate a password. 

The password is then ran and put together at random in a function that times the length of the array they selected by a random number using the random command.
